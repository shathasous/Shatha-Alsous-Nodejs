NodeJS Project
This is your FIRST project as a backend developer ü§© 

Week 4 - Project
Description
Create a Node.js program that reads a list of file paths from a configuration file and processes each file asynchronously. The processing involves counting the number of words in each file and displaying the results.
Background
This project covers the following topics:
Node.js project creation
NPM package manager
Async programming
JSON parsing
Some node native packages
Setup
Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it in your terminal.
Initialize a Node.js project by running: npm init -y.
Create a files directory and place some text files in it that you will use for testing.
Use npm to install any needed package(s) that would support your logic.
Configuration
Create a config.json file in the project directory to store the list of file paths to be processed. Example content:

{
  "files": [
    "files/file1.txt",
    "files/file2.txt",
    "files/file3.txt"
  ]
}
Code Flow
Your code should be written in a file called index.js
Run your program using node index.js
Later on, check how to use nodemon and run your code using nodemon index.js
Expected Output

files/file1.txt: 75 words
files/file2.txt: 103 words
files/file3.txt: 42 words
Testing
Your code should handle the following
Empty files
Files with special characters
Files that do not exist
You are always encouraged to check external resources to check how such cases are handled.
Coding Style
Make sure your code includes the following
Clean coding with proper readability
Proper comments and documentation
Your code should implemented in JavaScript.
